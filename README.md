### Reflection:
I start to like JQuery more after coding this game. I write all the code based on my own pseudo-code, which is a great improvement. This game does not take me a lot of time to build and I have learned to shorten my own code and so it is more semantic and concise. I am glad I start to understand the code more than before. 

The challenge part of this game is not the logic, but the CSS design. I actually started with Bootstrap first, but I decide to code my own CSS because I do not like the attribute restriction that I encounter in Bootstrap. I mean, I can even combine bootstrap with my own CSS, but I feel like I want to challenge myself a little. I am not too satisfied with the final design of this game, because I think there can be more improvements in terms of adding in animation and fixing media queries code to have it more semantic. Overall, writing my own CSS styling is more challenging than I thought.
